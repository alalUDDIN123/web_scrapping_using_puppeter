```

Once you have Puppeteer imported, you can start using its API to control the browser, navigate web pages, interact with elements, and extract data.

## Usage Examples
Here are some basic examples to give you an idea of how to use Puppeteer:

### Example 1: Opening a Web Page and Taking a Screenshot
```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com');
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'example.png' });
  
  await browser.close();
})();
```

### Example 2: Extracting Text from a Web Page
```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com');
  const textContent = await page.evaluate(() => document.body.textContent);
  console.log(textContent);
  
  await browser.close();
})();
```
